How to do screen capture on Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install recordmydesktop # for screen capture
sudo apt-get install mencoder # for changing from ogv to avi

Use xwindinfo to determine the window id of the application window you want to capture
xwininfo # click on the window you want to record to determine the window id

Start recording. If you want you can specify delay in seconds.
recordmydesktop --delay=5 --no-frame --stop-shortcut=Control+s --windowid=windowidhere # e.g. --windowid=0x440000c

You probably need to clip the recording a bit. You can use Pitivi for that.
pitivi

You may need to transform the finished clip to a format that is playable by others, or that Vimeo or Youtube accepts.
Mencoder is good for transforming ogv files to divx.
mencoder fallingcubes.ogv -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o fallingcubes.avi -nosound # convert to avi if needed
